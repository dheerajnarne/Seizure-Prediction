# HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification

## Overview

This project is part of a Kaggle competition focused on classifying harmful brain activity patterns. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify and differentiate between harmful and non-harmful brain activity based on given data. This classification can assist medical professionals in early diagnosis and intervention, potentially improving patient outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided by Kaggle and contains EEG signal data collected from multiple subjects. EEG (Electroencephalography) records electrical activity in the brain, and the dataset includes labeled examples of both harmful and non-harmful activity patterns. The data undergoes several preprocessing steps to remove noise, normalize values, and extract meaningful features for analysis.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the dataset, analyze trends, and train a machine learning model. Ensure that you have downloaded the dataset from Kaggle and placed it in the appropriate directory.

```bash
jupyter notebook Task2_1.ipynb
```

Within the notebook, you will find step-by-step instructions to:
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature extraction
3. Visualize EEG signals to gain insights into patterns
4. Train and evaluate various machine learning models, including Bidirectional LSTMs
5. Interpret the results and compare different approaches

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** Handling missing values, normalizing EEG signals, and feature extraction.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing EEG signal distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting relevant attributes from EEG signals to improve model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Model Training:** Implementing various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Deep Learning with Bidirectional LSTMs:** Using advanced Recurrent Neural Networks to capture temporal dependencies in EEG signals.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters for better classification performance.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Various machine learning algorithms, including Bidirectional LSTMs, are tested, and the results are compared to determine the most effective approach. The final model is validated on a test set to assess its real-world applicability.
